# User Interface
Modern web applications often use JavaScript frameworks to implement a single-page application that communicates with a RESTful API. Static web content can be served using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon CloudFront.
```
CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates delivery of your websites, APIs, video content, and other web assets.
```
Since clients of a microservice are served from the closest edge location and get responses either from a cache or a proxy server with optimized connections to the origin, latencies can be significantly reduced. However, microservices running close to each other don’t benefit from a CDN. This approach might even add more latency. It is a best practice to implement other caching mechanisms to reduce chattiness and minimize latencies.

# Microservices
The API of a microservice is the central entry point for all client requests. The application logic hides behind a set of programmatic interfaces, typically a RESTful web services API. This API accepts and processes calls from clients and might implement functionality such as traffic management, request filtering, routing, caching, and authentication and authorization. Many AWS customers use the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Application Load Balancer together with Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Auto Scaling to implement a microservices application. The Application Load Balancer routes traffic based on advanced application-level information that
includes the content of the request.
```
ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
```
The Application Load Balancer distributes incoming requests to Amazon ECS container instances running the API and the business logic.
```
Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker
containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
```
Amazon ECS container instances are scaled out and scaled in, depending on the load or the number of incoming requests. Elastic scaling allows the system to be run in a cost-efficient way and also helps protect against denial of service attacks.
```
Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define.
```
# Data Store
The data store is used to persist data needed by the microservices. Popular stores for session data are in-memory caches such as Memcached or Redis. AWS offers both technologies as part of the managed Amazon ElastiCache service.
```
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud.21 The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. 
```
Putting a cache between application servers and a database is a common mechanism to alleviate read load from the database, which, in turn, may allow resources to be used to support more writes. Caches can also improve latency. Relational databases are still very popular for storing structured data and business objects. AWS offers six database engines (Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Aurora) as managed services via Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).
```
Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you to focus on applications and business.
```
Since individual microservices are designed to do one thing well, they typically have a simplified data model that might be well suited to NoSQL persistence. It is important to understand that NoSQL-databases have different access patterns than relational databases. If this is necessary, the logic has to be implemented in the application. 
```
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
```

# API Implementation
The architecture we have described is already using managed services, but you still have to operate EC2 instances. We can further reduce the operational efforts needed to run, maintain, and monitor microservices by using a fully serverless architecture.

Architecting, continuously improving, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining an API can be a time-consuming task. Sometimes different versions of APIs need to be run to assure backward compatibility of all APIs for clients. The different stages of the development cycle (development, testing, and production) further multiply operational efforts. 
Access authorization is a critical feature for all APIs, but it is usually complex to build and involves repetitive work. When an API is published and becomes successful, the next challenge is to manage, monitor, and monetize the ecosystem of third-party developers utilizing the API. Other important features and challenges include throttling requests to protect the backend, caching API responses, request and response transformation, and generating API definitions and documentation with tools such as Swagger.
Amazon API Gateway addresses those challenges and reduces the operational complexity of creating and maintaining RESTful APIs.
```
API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
```

# Serverless Microservices
Getting rid of servers is the ultimate way to eliminate operational complexity.
```
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume – there is no
charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service – all with zero administration.
```
You simply upload your code and let Lambda take care of everything required to run and scale the execution to meet your actual demand curve with high availability. Lambda supports several programming languages and can be triggered from other AWS services or be called directly from any web or mobile application.
Lambda is highly integrated with API Gateway. The possibility of making synchronous calls from API Gateway to AWS Lambda enables the creation of fully serverless applications and is described in detail in our documentation.
